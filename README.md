## Step 1: Install and setup
You should follow instructions [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) from the official Flutter website. 

To check flutter version and dart version run these

`flutter --version`

`dart --version`

After this step, your computer should have flutter, dart, code editor ([Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is recommended) and Android device connected.
